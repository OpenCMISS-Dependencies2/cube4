                             ====================

Cube GUI is a graphics explorer for display and analysis of a multi-dimensional
performance space consisting of the dimensions (i) performance metric, (ii) call
path, and (iii) system resource. Each dimension can be represented as a tree, 
where non-leaf nodes of the tree can be collapsed or expanded to achieve the 
desired level of granularity. 

Cube GUI is released as open source under a BSD-style license. 
Please see the COPYING file in the package base directory for details.

    (CubePluginsUserGuide.pdf | plugins-guide/html/index.html):

   The Cube GUI Plugins Guide is currently being rewritten and still incomplete.

   Compendium of known limitations and unimplemented features that may affect
   Cube GUI usability on various platforms or with certain

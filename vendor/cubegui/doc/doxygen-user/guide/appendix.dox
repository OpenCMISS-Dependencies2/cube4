@section statFormat File format of statistics files

Statistic files (for an example see \apptitledref{below,An example of a statistic file}) are simply
text files which contain the necessary data.  The first line is always
ignored but should look similar to that in the example as it simplifies the
understanding for the human reader. \emph{All values in a statistic file
are simply separated by an arbitrary number of spaces}.

For each pattern there is a line which contains at least the pattern name
(as plain text \emph{without spaces}), its corresponding metric id in the
\cube file (integer as text) and the count -- i.e., how many instances
of the pattern exist (also as integer). If more values are provided, there
have to be the mean value, median, minimum and maximum as well as the sum
(all as floating point numbers in arbitrary format). If one of these values
is provided, all have to.  The next optional value is the variance (also as
a floating point number).  The last two optional values of which both or
none have to be provided are the 25% and the 75% quantile, also as
floating point numbers.

If any of these values is omitted, all following values have to be omitted,
too. If for example the variance is not provided, the lower and the upper
quartile must not be provided either.

In the subsequent lines (there can be an arbitrary number), the information
of the most severe instances is provided.  Each of these lines has to begin
with a minus sign (-). Then the text \emph{cnode:}, followed by the cnode
id of this instance in the \cube file (integer as text) is provided. The
same holds for enter, exit and duration (floats as text).

The begin of the next pattern is indicated by a blank line.
